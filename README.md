===========

RSS Reader or JellyReader is an app that stores all your articles on Google Drive and Dropbox! The data is completely self-hosted on your personal cloud, so it can never go down or go away.

##You can also clone this to run your own self-hosted version on github!

1. Clone this repository
2. Update the keys under https://github.com/NimbusBase/jellyreader/blob/gh-pages/js/multi.coffee

  For Dropbox, go to: https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps

  For Google, go to: https://cloud.google.com/console/project and create your own id and add your current github page URL as to both the domain and the URL redirect settings.

3. Everything should now run!
